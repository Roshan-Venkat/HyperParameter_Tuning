# HyperParameter_Tuning
Hyper parameter tuning is crucial for all deep learning/ machine learning models, this notebook represent some techinques to choose best hyperparameters. The notebook and model are based on *MNIST* data set(had written digits)
There are some visualization done
The Below Image represtent the weights in the first layer.
